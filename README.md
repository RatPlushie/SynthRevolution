# SynthRevolution
Android Application to control the visor in a Synth's Cranial module

With this application users will be able to pair their android phones with the bluetooth module within the visor. Allowing for a customised display and personality of the Synth.

A Synth's cranial visor contains, at minimum, two 8*8 RGB LED matricies. Further development will allow for more components to be detected by the software and controlled via the app.

Currently there is no unified software for these Synths and having this application and code base available will allow for ease of use and more exposure to them. Making for a suit-agnostic application.
